# USA-shootings


Lately, A few police shooting incidents disturbed the peace of a few neighborhood in my city.  For example, the shooting death of Saheed Vassell, a man that suffered from bipolar disorder. Police fatally shot him after mistaking a pipe, that Saheed was holding, for a gun. 

Similar incidents have happened many times during the past year, so I am just curious about how often it happens in each city in this country. 

Some of my questions might be:

1, which city and state has the most number of police shooting.

2, Does racial background correlate to the number being shot by police?

3, How about age, gender, education, income, and poverty rate? Do areas with higher poverty rate have a higher number of such incidents?
